Setup guide for the Weather-Based Activity Suggestion Service
###########
We have developed a service that suggests activities based on weather forecasts. This service comes in two versions:

1.HTML Version: Simply open the file in a browser to use.(tripadvisor-project/public/FinalProject.html)
2.Node.js Version: Requires setting up a local server.


This document explains the setup process for version 2, the Node.js version.
This application uses the Tripadvisor API, which is free for up to 5000 calls. To use this API, you need to set up either domain restrictions or IP address restrictions.

Preparation for Tripadvisor API Use

1.Visit Tripadvisor Developers and create an account.  https://www.tripadvisor.com/developers
2.In the My API menu, register your current IP address, appending /32 to the end. For example, if your IP address is 99.123.123.12, register it as 99.123.123.12/32.
    Check your IP address here https://whatismyipaddress.com/
3.Copy the API key from the My API menu and add it to line 9 of server.js in the tripadvisor-project folder.
